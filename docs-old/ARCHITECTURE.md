# azphalt — Architecture & Reasoning

*azphalt is an open, portable extension standard for creative apps — write an extension once, run it in any app that adopts it — plus a consignment marketplace built on top. This document is the architecture and the reasoning behind each decision.*

---

## What lives here — two things, kept separable

1. **The standard** *(open, MIT)* — the `.azp` format spec, the SDK extensions are written against, the asset importers, the reference runtime, and the registry. This is the thing other apps adopt. It must be, and look, vendor-neutral.
2. **The marketplace** *(a business, on top)* — a consignment storefront: a commercial venue sitting on the open standard, the way a store sits on Open VSX. Its code can be MIT or private — your call — but it is architecturally downstream of the standard, never fused to it. The format is `azphalt`; the store can carry its own name.

Keeping these separable is the core constraint: anyone can implement azphalt and even run their own store; yours is just the flagship.

## Why azphalt is a separate repo from GraffitiXR

- **Credible neutrality.** A standard trapped in an app's repo reads as that app's private thing, and no competitor adopts it. Separation is the first structural signal that it's shared infrastructure.
- **A physical moat boundary.** A separate MIT repo literally cannot see a host's proprietary engine source. "The extension surface never exposes GraffitiXR's relocalization engine" stops being a discipline you maintain and becomes a line you *can't cross by accident*.
- **Clean dependency direction.** A conforming host (GraffitiXR is the first) depends on azphalt as a published library and calls across the boundary. azphalt never depends on any host.

## The stack, and why

**TypeScript everywhere** in this repo. It's the language every ecosystem you're recruiting from already writes plugins in — VS Code, Figma, and Canva extensions are all TS — so authors get types and autocomplete for free, and "the language you already know" is part of the pitch.

**React is one surface, not the whole thing.** Split it by where a browser actually is:

| Component | Stack | React? |
|---|---|---|
| The marketplace storefront | Next.js + TS | **Yes** — textbook fit |
| The registry (host/version/search/serve packages) | Node/TS service + API | No — its browse UI can reuse the storefront's React |
| The SDK (what authors build against) | TS | No — it's a library, not a UI |
| Extension **UI** | **Declarative schema**, host-rendered | **No** — see below |
| Extension **execution** | **WASM substrate** (QuickJS-in-WASM for JS), on-device | No — decided, see below |

**Two decisions fall out, and neither is React — these are the real architecture:**

- **Execution substrate.** Extensions don't run in a browser; they run inside a native host — GraffitiXR, for instance, is a Kotlin/Compose Android app. **Decided: a WASM substrate** — not React Native (which drags a whole runtime and renderer into a Compose app to do what a lean embedded runtime does lighter), and not a bare JS engine. In short, WASM is the substrate and JS runs on it via QuickJS-in-WASM, so the single TS SDK survives and behavior is deterministic across hosts.
- **Extension UI.** A declarative UI schema the host renders as native controls — *not* React-in-a-webview (the Figma model). This is what keeps azphalt genuinely cross-app: if a plugin's UI is a control schema, a Kotlin app renders it in Compose and a SwiftUI app renders it natively; if it's React/HTML, every adopting app is forced to ship a webview, which quietly breaks "any app can implement." Portability argues against React here.

The native host that embeds the engine and renders the schema is **each app's own conforming implementation** (GraffitiXR writes the Kotlin one). This repo ships the language-neutral spec plus the TS/JS reference so any host can be checked against it.

The **importers normalize into `.azp`**, which makes them the seeding mechanism: every `.abr` a user imports becomes a portable package, so the catalog fills as a byproduct of people bringing brushes they already own. Define the format first (even minimally) and point the importers at it.

## The marketplace — consignment model

**Two lanes, and the fee lives in only one.** The standard/storefront split, made concrete about money:

- **The registry** = free, open distribution. No payment rails, no fee. A creator who just wants reach publishes here for nothing and monetizes externally if they choose — the VS Code / Open VSX answer, where the platform touches no money. This lane is what keeps the standard adoptable.
- **The marketplace storefront** = the consignment lane. The *only* place the fee exists, because it's the only place you've taken on selling. A creator who'd rather you handle the money lists here — the Clip Studio answer.

Keeping the fee out of the registry is what lets the standard stay neutral while the storefront is a business.

Storefront-lane details:

- **Non-exclusive recruitment.** Creators are free agents; the incumbent platforms rent their work, they don't own it, so the marketplace can court the whole existing base at once. Caveat: some platforms offer *opt-in* exclusive tiers for a higher cut (Adobe Stock, historically Envato), so a slice lock in voluntarily for the rate — your terms have to beat what exclusivity pays them. Thin fee + portability across every adopting app is a strong hand for it.
- **Payment is outsourced** to a payment provider / merchant-of-record — the right call, and what dissolves most of the "running the rails" burden: tax/VAT, chargebacks, and compliance become the provider's problem. One sharpening: a *marketplace* is a different payment shape than single-vendor selling. You take money from a buyer, split it, and pay out a third-party creator — that's split-payment / marketplace-payout territory (Stripe Connect and the like, or a marketplace-capable MoR), **not** a plain single-vendor MoR built for solo SaaS. Provider choice hinges on split-payout + seller-onboarding support — verify against current docs before picking one.
- **What doesn't outsource:** curation / moderation of what's listed (malware, IP), and being the marketplace facilitator of record for creator tax forms. The provider does the mechanics; you own the policy.
- **"Very small" has a floor — and outsourcing raises it.** The fee must clear the processor (~3% + a fixed cost per transaction) *plus the provider's cut on top* *plus* overhead, or you lose money per sale, and it only nets at volume. Outsourcing trades margin for not running the rails — the right trade for a solo dev, but the fee has to absorb the stacked cuts. Build the importers and the free catalog first; the paid marketplace follows users.

## Licensing & boundary

- Everything in azphalt: **MIT** (`LICENSE` at repo root). The marketplace storefront can be MIT or private.
- A host's engine is **not here and cannot be referenced.** The SDK exposes only editor extension points — layers, bitmaps, canvas. GraffitiXR's PolyForm engine stays in GraffitiXR, behind the boundary.
- This is the same MIT/PolyForm line from GraffitiXR's `LICENSING.md`, now enforced as a repo boundary instead of a module boundary.

## Governance / neutrality

Cross-app adoption needs credible neutrality: an open spec, an open decision process, a neutral name. The honest tension for a solo project — you seed it and benefit from it, but control caps adoption. Minimum viable: public spec + open issue/RFC process now; a neutral-foundation path later if it gains real traction.

**Self-hostability is the adoption driver — and it is not in tension with consignment.** Adopting a standard is a *control* decision, not a convenience one: no serious app, least of all a competitor, will build its product on infrastructure a rival meters, controls, and can revoke. Requiring another app to route its users' extensions and its ecosystem's money through your consignment store — where you take a cut and hold the rails — asks to be its landlord and tax collector; that is an anti-adoption force, not a business model. This is exactly the Open VSX story: Microsoft's marketplace is legally locked to Microsoft's own products, so every VS Code fork (VSCodium, Cursor, Theia, Gitpod) *couldn't* use it and the community built a vendor-neutral, self-hostable registry instead. Self-hostability is what made adoption possible.

The two-lane design already gives both:

- **The standard + registry stay open and self-hostable** — the layer other apps adopt, free and neutral, nobody forced through your store. This is what wins adoption.
- **The consignment marketplace is a hosted service on top** — one venue, not the toll booth. Never a precondition for adopting the standard.

This is the npm / Docker Hub / Maven Central pattern: the format is open and self-hostable, yet a dominant hosted registry still captures most usage because it's the best default. Openness drives adoption; the hosted default captures convenience.

Which answers the obvious worry — *"if it's self-hostable, can't anyone run a competing store and cost me the revenue?"* In practice, no: open registries consolidate around a canonical hosted default, because running and moderating a registry is real work and being the best-curated, best-discovery venue is a genuine moat of convenience and network effect. **You win the marketplace by being the best host, not by locking the standard** — and the openness is what created the audience the marketplace monetizes. The sequence runs one way only: open standard → adoption → audience → your store monetizes that audience. Consignment-first strangles the adoption that would make consignment worth anything.

So: keep the standard open and self-hostable, require nobody to touch the store to adopt it, and offer hosted consignment as the turnkey default. Self-host for competitors, enterprises, and the privacy-conscious who need independence; hosted for indies and small apps who'd rather not run infrastructure or handle payments. **Offer both, require neither.**

## Sequencing

1. **Spec skeleton** — package format, extension manifest, capability model, UI schema. The seed.
2. **SDK + first importers** — `.abr` and `.cube` (highest ROI, cleanest fidelity), targeting `.azp`.
3. **Reference runtime** — prove an extension actually runs against the contract.
4. **GraffitiXR native host** — embed the engine, render the UI schema in Compose. The first real consumer.
5. **Registry + marketplace** — Phase 2+, once there's an audience.

## Execution engine — decided

**A WASM substrate — one substrate, not three engines.** QuickJS and Hermes are JS *engines*; WASM is the compilation *target* they'd sit inside. So rather than cloning engines, compile *to* WASM:

- **Default (JS/TS) on-ramp:** authors write TypeScript → JS → run on **QuickJS-compiled-to-WASM** (the Javy pattern, in production at Shopify). Keeps the TS audience and the single SDK; QuickJS is ~1/40th of V8's footprint.
- **Performance on-ramp:** hot filters ship as raw WASM (Rust / AssemblyScript), and JS can drop to WASM for tight pixel loops. One host API, one runtime, two on-ramps.
- **Behavior, not performance, is what's identical.** WASM's deterministic execution gives identical *results* across platforms for free — target behavioral conformance (a test suite), not the impossible-and-pointless goal of equal performance.

**Remaining sub-decision:** on Android, run WASM via **Chicory** (pure-JVM WASM runtime — no native binaries, no JNI; simpler, slower) vs a **native runtime** (Wasmtime / WAMR via JNI — faster, but per-ABI binary cost). Off the shelf, **QuickJs4j** already does QuickJS → WASM → Chicory → pure JVM bytecode. Likely path: mainstream JS extensions on Chicory, performance-critical raw-WASM filters on a native runtime — or start all-Chicory and optimize. Design the image-buffer ABI (shared linear memory) deliberately; it's what bites a pixel app.

## Open questions

1. **UI schema expressiveness:** rich enough for real tool UIs, constrained enough to render natively on every host.
2. **Importer distribution:** shared TS/WASM modules any host runs, vs per-host native reimplementation.
3. **Registry:** adopt/fork Open VSX's implementation vs build from scratch.
4. **Governance model.**
