# @azphalt/conformance

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 19c0df7: Relicensed from MIT to the Apache License 2.0, which adds an explicit patent grant and patent retaliation — for a standard other hosts implement, implementers are licensed for contributors' patents, not only their copyright. Every freedom MIT gave is kept; extensions published through azphalt keep their own licences, and `create-azphalt` still writes whichever licence a creator picks.
- fffb800: Harden the host side — the clients, runtimes and conformance suite that consume `.azp` packages:
  
  - **repository-client.** `download()` accepts `expectedDigest` and verifies it, bounds the total with `maxBytes` (the size comes from the server's `Content-Range`), and rejects a short or oversized chunk instead of leaving a zero-filled hole. Package ids and versions are URL-encoded, so a hostile pack member can't redirect a request carrying the bearer token.
  - **mcp.** `extractAsset` verifies the package first, and no longer resolves `__proto__`/`constructor` as asset names. The `azp_verify` description no longer implies `signed: true` identifies a signer.
  - **llm-host.** `scrub` runs to a fixpoint (nested `<|im_<|x|>start|>` could previously be spliced into a live chat-template marker). `chatLlm` rejects non-string content (an array bypassed the session-tag check), no longer sends the bearer to an `auth: none` endpoint, and resolves `${input:…}` base URLs through a new `inputs` option (`llmConsent` no longer throws on them). `installLlm` now requires `consented: true`, refuses an unsigned package (unless `allowUnsigned`), honours `trustedKeys`, validates the package id and owner/repo, and audits the runner workflow with the new `auditWorkflow` — only declared secrets, no `pull_request_target`, no write beyond the manifest's ceiling.
  - **runtime-wasm.** A caller can narrow but never widen the capabilities a package declared. A contribution whose promise never settles is an error, not a silent success. `params`/`assets`/module lookups use own-property checks. Guest `layers.create` is capped. The raw-wasm path bounds module size and memory (`MAX_WASM_MODULE_BYTES`, `MAX_WASM_MEMORY_BYTES`); a non-terminating wasm entry still blocks its thread, so hosts must run untrusted raw-wasm packages in a terminable Worker/process.
  - **web-handoff.** Host-directory install URLs must be `https:` or `market:` (`isSafeInstallUrl`).
  - **azdk.** `Capability` drops the deferred `storage`; `RepositoryErrorResponse` gains `details`.
  - **conformance.** The reject-tampered and reject-unsafe-path checks now drive the host (with a control package it must run), and the capability-gating checks require a baseline run so a host that refuses everything can't pass by erroring. The "has teeth" tests simulate a broken host honestly.
  - **repository-server.** A `private` package's detail is access-gated like its download, and `HEAD` is routed like `GET` (a download `HEAD` doesn't count).
- b382e11: `runLlmConformance` certifies an `"llm"` host (`spec/llm.md` § Conformance), and `HostProfile` gains `"llm"`. The host must:
  - refuse tampered, unsafe-path, non-`llm`, over-permissioned and incompatible packages;
  - disclose the tier, prompt handling and setup-token permissions before install, and keep setup off the device;
  - translate rolling delimiters so no tag or native control marker reaches the model, checked against the reference runner's vectors;
  - reject output carrying any session tag.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f36110b: Add `kind: "script"` — a native script (bash, Python, PowerShell, …) a host installs and runs the way a package manager installs its own package, resolving declared system `dependencies` (namespaced by package manager) before making the script runnable. Adds the `Kind`/`ScriptManifest` SDK types, `@azphalt/azp`'s `validateScriptManifest` (folded into `verifyAzp`), `@azphalt/conformance`'s `script` host-conformance profile (`runScriptConformance`), a `create-azphalt` "Script" template, and submission validation for the new kind. Like `kind:"mcp"`, a script needs real OS access to do anything useful, so it gets its own kind rather than a "native" flavor of `kind:"code"` — that keeps `code`'s one unconditional guarantee (sandboxed, powerless, safe to auto-run) intact. See `spec/script.md`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bdbdb9b: Add `kind: "skill"` — a bundle of one or more [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) (`SKILL.md` + optional `scripts`/`references`/`assets`) an AI-agent host loads. Adds the `Kind`/`SkillManifest`/`SkillEntry` SDK types, `@azphalt/azp`'s `validateSkillManifest` (folded into `verifyAzp`), `@azphalt/conformance`'s `skill` host-conformance profile (`runSkillConformance`), a `create-azphalt` "Skill" template, and submission validation for the new kind. See `spec/skill.md`.
